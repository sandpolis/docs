# Sandpolis Official Documentation
This site explains how to **install**, **configure**, and **maintain** Sandpolis.
It also contains the official specification and a high-level programming reference
useful to developers.

## The Basics
You are likely already familiar with other remote-control applications that allow
you to monitor/manage many different computers from a single pane of glass. To
use these tools, you might install an *agent* on the computers you wish to manage
and direct them to connect back to the main application running on your workstation.

While relatively simple, there are some evident disadvantages to this approach:

- Your computer may not have a stable IP address or be reachable over the Internet
- You may want to quickly perform rudimentary tasks away from your computer such
as from a mobile device
- This architecture does not scale as the number of agents increases

Most modern administration systems now use a client-server-agent (CSA) architecture
to address these problems. Rather than connecting agents directly to an application
on your computer, a central server mediates interactions between you and your systems.

### Client <==> Server <==> Agent
With CSA, clients and agents can come and go without affecting the rest of the 
network. This means that:

- background or scheduled tasks can continue after a user logs out;
- users are not restricted to a particular user interface;
- users don't have to adjust their firewalls or port-forwarding rules.

CSA also comes with a few drawbacks:

###### The server is another application to maintain
Although easy to deploy, the Sandpolis server still requires some effort to maintain.
In addition to the initial setup, it's important to periodically update the server
and harden its security.

###### The server is a high value attack target
The server is designed to be as resilient and secure as possible, but it can't be
perfect. If an attacker is able to compromise the server (or a user account with
sufficiently high privileges), they effectively have full control over all systems
connected to it.

To help mitigate the risks, all Sandpolis user accounts are **required** to use
two-factor authentication and password rotation.

Access alerts can also be configured to help unauthorized accesses get noticed
as early as possible.

###### The server can increase network latency
Usually the network route between a user and their systems will be faster than the
route through the server. This is especially true if a user is on the same lan as
their systems. To improve latency and throughput, the server can automatically
coordinate a direct connection between any two nodes for high-volume or time-sensitive
messages like remote desktop, file transfers, etc.

### Real-time monitoring
Sandpolis offers "real-time" monitoring and management when you need it, and efficient
scalability when you're not looking.

### Extensibility via plugins
